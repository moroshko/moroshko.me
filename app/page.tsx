        <p>
          Iâ€™m a Front End engineer from Melbourne, Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º
          <br />I love building web stuff that bring people joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I care a lot about visual design, UX, accessibility and performance.
          Design Systems and Open Source have a special place in my heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like collaborating with kind, like-minded individuals who are
          constantly learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel productive these days with TypeScript, Tailwind, and Next.js
          deployed on Vercel.
        </p>
        <p>
          When not coding, I recharge through playing chess to exercise my mind,
          playing tennis to stay active, and spending quality time with my
          loving family.
        </p>
