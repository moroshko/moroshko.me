      <p>
        Iâ€™m a Front End engineer from Melbourne, Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º
        <br />I love building web stuff that bring people joy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I care a lot about visual design, UX, accessibility and performance.
        Design Systems and Open Source have a special place in my heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like collaborating with kind, like-minded individuals who are
        constantly learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel productive these days with TypeScript, Tailwind, and Next.js
        deployed on Vercel.
      </p>
      <p>
        When not coding, I recharge through playing chess to exercise my mind,
        hitting the tennis court to stay active, and spending quality time with
        my loving family.
